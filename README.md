CS 230 Project Software Design 
1. Client and Software Requirements:
The client, The Gaming Room, sought to engage Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) for the development of a web-based version of their Android app game,
"Draw It or Lose It." The game revolves around teams guessing puzzles represented by stock drawings.
The primary software requirements were to support multiple teams, assign players to teams, ensure unique game and team names, and maintain only one game instance in memory.

3. Strengths in Developing Documentation:
In developing this documentation, I excelled in clarity and structure. The document follows a standard template with well-organized sections that cover essential aspects such as requirements,
design constraints, architecture, and evaluation. It ensures that the client's needs and project details are comprehensively addressed and easy to reference.

5. Benefits of Working Through a Design Document:
The process of working through a design document played a pivotal role in bridging the gap between conceptualizing the software and actual development.
It helped in creating a clear roadmap, ensuring that all requirements were considered, and decisions were well-documented. This process acted as a blueprint for development,
reducing ambiguities and making it easier to identify potential issues before they occurred.

7. Area for Revision:
If I could revise one aspect of my work, I would enhance the Evaluation section. While I provided substantial information regarding different operating platforms and their development considerations,
I could have offered more specific recommendations and analyzed the pros and cons in greater depth. Providing a more detailed evaluation would have been more informative for the client.

9. Interpreting User Needs:
Interpreting the user's needs involved a comprehensive analysis of the client's requirements, considering aspects like scalability,
user preferences, and budget constraints. It was essential to understand the client's vision and the end-users' expectations to design software that aligns with their objectives.
User needs are crucial as they ensure that the software not only fulfills its technical requirements but also delivers a satisfying and user-friendly experience.

11. Software Design Approach:
In designing the software, I adopted a systematic approach. I analyzed the client's requirements, broke them down into functional components, and leveraged design patterns and principles to create an efficient and maintainable solution.
In the future, I would continue using this approach, focusing on modularity, scalability, and adaptability to ensure the software can evolve to meet changing needs.

Overall, this software design project for The Gaming Room exemplifies the importance of thorough documentation and understanding the client's needs. 
It reinforced the significance of clear and structured design processes to create software that not only meets technical specifications but also aligns with user expectations. 
Future projects will benefit from this experience by building on the best practices and the lessons learned in this endeavor.
